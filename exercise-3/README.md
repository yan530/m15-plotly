# Exercise-3
In this exercise, you will be creating a grouped bar chart using US cancer mortality rate data from [IHME](http://www.healthdata.org/).

Specifically, you will be using data from only Washington State and the chart that you will attempt to recreate is based on Neoplasms mortality rates in King County from 2005 - 2014. 

Below is a static image of what you will hopefully make by the end of this exercise:
